        An artist sought treatment from an analyst who specialized in multiple
        personalities and began to develop signs of dissociative identity
        disorder.

      <Text>
        Four years and 10 personalities later, the patient pseudonymously
        referred to as Sybil wrote to her analyst, "I do not really have any
        multiple personalities. I do not even have a 'double.' I am all of
        them."
      </Text>
      <Text>
        But the analyst refused to accept Sybil's confession and Sybil
        recanted, ultimately developing six additional personalities. Whether
        or not Sybil had formed these personalities to please her analyst, the
        analyst could not but be formed by them.

        overidentifications and misrecog-nitions, synthetic doppelg√§ngers and
        real strangers.
