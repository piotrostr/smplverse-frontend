        An artist sought treatment from an analyst with an interest in multiple
        personalities and began to develop signs of dissociative identity
        disorder.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Four years and 10 personalities later, the patient pseudonymously
        referred to as Sybil wrote to her analyst, "I do not really have any
        multiple personalities. I do not even have a 'double.' I am all of
        them."

        But the analyst refused to accept Sybil's confession and Sybil
        recanted, ultimately developing six additional personalities.

      <Text>
        Whether or not Sybil formed these personalities out of an obsession
        with her analyst, her analyst could not but become obsessed with them.

        doppelg√§ngers and real strangers.

        of the signs that become my signature. <i>Signo, ergo sum.</i>
