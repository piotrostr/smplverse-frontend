      SMPLverse is an NFT collection from the computational infrastructure of
      the metaverse, assigned to minters using facial recognition.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      The collection comprises 7,667 synthetic face images used to develop face
      tracking algorithms for Microsoft's mixed reality headsets.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      After minting, you receive a token that allows you to submit an image
      through the webcam interface above. Your submitted image is stored
      on-chain as a hash.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Our facial recognition model then matches your image to a smpl. When the
      image is matched, it receives one attribute: confidence.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Confidence assesses the likelihood that your image matches the smpl you
      receive.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Confidence is a declining measure: as more smpls are minted, your
      likelihood of receiving a high confidence match decreases.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Conversely, your likelihood of receiving a smpl with rarer visual
      attributes increases.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      11 smpls will split 55% of secondary revenue. These rare smpls are
      clustered by head pose.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      After the mint, we'll be delivering mixed reality experiences to bring
      your smpl into the physical world.

      Like many PFP projects, SMPLverse was procedurally generated. The
      training dataset it derives from combines SMPL, a body mesh used to
      animate avatars in virtual environments, with a generative 3D face model
      and a library of artist-authored assets. These synthetics bear a striking
      resemblance to the metaverse avatars whose naturalism they are meant to
      enhance.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      By foregrounding the dependence on hardware and software developed by
      major tech platforms, SMPLverse gives form to the
      "centralization-in-the-loop‚Äù character of the metaverse: each NFT is a
      tool to access the infrastructure that underlies your virtual identity.
