address the reroll issues post mint

use local storage

fully functionally-test the app

mobile scale

also store metadata on ipfs

if there is local storage image or other sign of activity, dont show the intro screen

make sure the smpl shows straight after getting it (upload to aws s3 on success)

use the infura endpoint instead of ipfs for images, might be quicker
